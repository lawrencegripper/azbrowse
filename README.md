# AzBrowse

An interactive CLI for browsing azure resources, inspired by [resources.azure.com](https://resources.azure.com)

[![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/lawrencegripper/azbrowse/tree/master.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/lawrencegripper/azbrowse/tree/master)

# Quick Start

Simply download the binary suitable for your machine, [from the release page](https://github.com/lawrencegripper/azbrowse/releases), and execute it.

### Status

It's an MVP to prove out the use case. Basic navigation and operations with a boltdb based cache for expensive (slow) API calls.

Currently I'm using it every day **but it is experimental so use with caution on a production environment!!**

### Install

#### DIY

Grab the zipped binaries, deb or rpm's from the release page and install.

#### Run via Docker 

Ensure you have the `az` command setup on your machine and are logged in. You can then start `azbrowse` in docker by mounting in your `$HOME` directory so `azbrowse` can access the login details from your machine inside the docker container.

```
docker run -it -v $HOME:/root lawrencegripper/azbrowse
```

### Usage

Below is a table containing the default key bindings. If you'd like to customise the key bindings to be more suitable for your setup, please refer to the section on [custom key bindings](#custom-key-bindings).

## Navigation

| Key       | Does                 |
| --------- | -------------------- |
| ↑/↓       | Select resource      |
| Backspace | Go back              |
| ENTER     | Expand/View resource |

## Operations

| Key                 | Does                      |                                                                                    |
| ------------------- | ------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| CTRL+E              | Toggle Browse JSON        | For longer responses you can move the cursor to scroll the doc                     |
| CTRL+o (o for open) | Open Portal               | Opens the portal at the currently selected resource                                |
| DEL:                | Delete resource           | The currently selected resource will be deleted (Requires double press to confirm) |
| CTLT+F:             | Toggle Fullscreen         | Gives a fullscreen view of the JSON for smaller terminals                          |
| CTLT+S:             | Save JSON to clipboard    | Saves the last JSON response to the clipboard for export                           |
| CTLT+A:             | View Actions for resource | This allows things like ListKeys on storage or Restart on VMs                      |




## Debugging

Running `azbrowse --debug` will start an in-memory collector for the `opentracing` and a GUI to browse this at http://localhost:8700. You can use this to look at tracing information output by `azbrowse` as it runs.

## Developing

### Environment Setup

> Note: Golang 1.12 is recommended. 

First, clone this repository. `azbrowse` is written in [Go][golang] and so you will want to set up your Go development environment first. If this is your first time, the [offical install guide][installguide] is probably a good place to start. Make sure you have `GOPATH/bin` in your `PATH`, using the instructions [here][gopath] as guidance on doing that.

In addition to installing [Go][golang], there are a couple of tool dependencies you'll need. These are:

- [Golang CI linter][golangcilinter]
- [Dep; Go dependency management tool][golang]

You can install these yourself following the instructions on their github pages, or you can run...

 ``` bash
 make setup
 ```

 This runs the script `scripts/install_dev_tools.sh`, which will install these tools for you.

### Building

With your Go development environment set up, use `make` to build `azbrowse`.

Take a look at the `Makefile` yourself, but the main rules are:

#### Run Tests and Build

``` bash
make build
```

#### Install Local Development Build


``` bash
make install
```

#### Run Travis-CI build locally

``` bash
make ci-docker
```

To run the full Travis-CI locally, you need to have the `TRAVIS_BUILD_NUMBER` environment variable defined, so running it as follows may be easier:

```bash
TRAVIS_BUILD_NUMBER=0.1 make ci-docker
```

## Custom Key Bindings

If you wish to override the default key bindings, create a `~/.azbrowse-bindings.json` file (where `~` is your users home directory).

The file should be formated like so:
```json
{
    ...
    "Copy": "F8",
    "Help": "Ctrl+H",
    ...
}
```

In the file you can override the keys for actions using keys from the lists below.

### Actions

| Actions:       | Does                                  |
| ------------------------ | --------------------------------------|

| Copy                     | Copies the resource JSON to clipboard |
| ListDelete               | Deletes a resources                   |

| Help                     | Toggles help view                     |
| ItemBack                 | Go back from an item to a list        |
| ItemLeft                 | Switch from the item json to the menu |
| ListActions              | List available actions on a resource  |
| ListBack                 | Go back on a list                     |
| ListBackLegacy           | Go back on a list (legacy terminals)  |
| ListDown                 | Navigate down a list                  |
| ListUp                   | Navigate up a list                    |
| ListRight                | Switch from the list to an item view  |
| ListEdit                 | Toggle edit mode on a resource        |
| ListExpand               | Expand a selected resource            |
